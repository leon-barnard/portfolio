Many UX techniques fall apart in the real world of overflowing backlogs, two-week sprints, and stubborn stakeholders. Yet wireframing persists, despite its much-anticipated demise. 

**Wireframing for Everyone** is a book I co-wrote with [Michael Angeles and Billy Carlson](https://abookapart.com/blogs/press/get-to-know-michael-angeles-leon-barnard-and-billy-carlson "target=_blank"), originally published by [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/products/wireframing-for-everyone). It's a product design book written for anyone wanting to learn how to turn an idea into reality and communicate about design within a software team.

Wireframes are *still* the fastest and easiest way for designers and non-designers alike to share product ideas, requirements, and feedback. They can be created and understood by anyone, and function as both creative ideation and practical communication tools. 

Building on our decades of combined experience, my co-authors and I explain how low-fidelity design can be used to get everyone involved in the design process. We show how wireframes can help ideas come to life efficiently and break down communication barriers, by focusing on structure and patterns instead of pixels.
