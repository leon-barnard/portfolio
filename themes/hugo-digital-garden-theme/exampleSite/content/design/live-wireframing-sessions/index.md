In 2 separate roles I researched and wrote design specifications for new features. In each case I delivered the UI design and provided detailed acceptance criteria for how those features should behave.

This information gave the development team the detail they needed to do the work, and provided the QA team with the information they needed to test that it did what it was supposed to do.

## Gumboot Friday

In this session Leon works with Chris from The Key to Life Charitable Trust on the website for a program called Gumboot Friday which connects young people in distress with counsellors or therapists.

In the first video they go through the audience and goals of the project and begin to outline the controls and components of the home page.

## Legal Ascend

In this session Leon works with Varonique Philander on her project, Legal Ascend, which guides people through the challenging process of dealing with a loved one's estate assets after their death.

They review the goals and existing design and then move on to wireframing a redesign for the home page that is more clear and approachable.

## Food donation for people impacted by COVID

In this session Leon works with Nicole Davidson on her idea to create an online resource for finding nearby food donations, primarily aimed at people who have been financially affected by COVID-19.

They discuss the background and goals of the project and wireframe an idea for an easy-to-use location search site.

In this session Leon works with Niall Thewlis who runs Radio Siamsa an online streaming station that plays exclusively Irish traditional music. It is funded solely by listener support.
