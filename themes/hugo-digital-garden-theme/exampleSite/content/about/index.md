I'm a User Experience Specialist, Content and Technical Writer, and co-author of [_Wireframing for Everyone_](/writing/wireframing-for-everyone/), published by A Book Apart. 

The unifying theme throughout my career has been helping people and technology get along better.

This site highlights some of my notable work across writing, speaking, and UX design.
