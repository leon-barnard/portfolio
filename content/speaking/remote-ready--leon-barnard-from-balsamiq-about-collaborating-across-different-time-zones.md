Title: 'Remote-Ready: Leon Barnard from Balsamiq about collaborating across different time-zones'
Draft: false
Summary: 'Founded in 2008 by Giacomo “Peldi” Guilizzoni, Balsamiq has grown into an industry-leading rapid wireframing software that has been used by Apple, Skype, Ebay or even Adobe. Balsamiq is a remote-first company, that cares mostly about two things: Work should be fun, and life is too short for bad software.'
